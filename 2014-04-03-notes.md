### Threading in Node

[Isolates](http://izs.me/v8-docs/classv8_1_1Isolate.html) is the V8 feature to allow multiple interpreters (engines) to run in a multiple threads with a single process.

Node added support for Isolates in 0.7 and [removed them in 0.7.3](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/nodejs/zLzuo292hX0/F7gqfUiKi2sJ).

*TODO* Does this work in node >= 0.7.3? https://github.com/xk/node-threads-a-gogo

### Outline

* Intro
  * ~~Lytics is hiring! wooooo~~
  * ~~Define Concurrency vs. Parallelism~~
    * ~~Rob Pike's "Concurrency is not Parallelism" http://vimeo.com/49718712~~
      * -- ~~"Concurrency is the composition of independently executing things (often functions)."~~
      * -- ~~"Parallelism is the simultaneous execution of multiple things; possibly related, possibly not."~~
      * -- ~~"Concurrency is about *dealing* with a lot of things at once. Parallelism is about *doing* a lot of things at once."~~
  * ~~Software, not Hardware~~
    * ~~Mention Transputer & vector processing anyway~~
  * ~~Application level, not distributed~~
  * ~~Define primitives vs. models~~
    * ~~Cite threading is not a model~~
* Primitives
  * ~~History dump (spoiler: it was all done in the 60s)~~
  * Modern "primitives"
    * Futex (just an implementation improvement; illustrates implementation details make all the difference)
    * RCU http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-copy-update (thanks @drevell!)
* Models
  * SEDA, Actors, CSP (spoiler: it was all done in the 70s)
* Evolution of arguments
  * Spoiler: it was all done before 1980 and culminated in http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~mema/courses/mde518/papers/lauer78.pdf
  * 90s: Windows made threads cheap and easy
  * 00s: Threads must die, event everything
    * Or not: http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/papers/threads-hotos-2003.pdf
  * Now: WAR

"Threads, as a **model** of computation, are wildly non-deterministic, and the job of the programmer becomes one of pruning that nondeterminism." â€” The Problem with Threads, Edward A. Lee, UC Berkeley, 2006 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computer_science)

#### History -> Evolution Transition

* *How do I go from History->Evolution->Threads?*


#### TODO

* Does this still sound clever in the morning? https://twitter.com/schmichael/status/451215999929307138
* Barriers... too hardware? Same idea occurs in software but as a pattern... perhaps too broad a concept to easily distill.
* Fork/join... design pattern? (combines multiple primitives, but doesn't seem like a full programming model) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork%E2%80%93join_queue
* Atomics and how they're not really concurrent or nonblocking or lockfree
 * slide 5: https://cug.org/5-publications/proceedings_attendee_lists/CUG10CD/pages/1-program/final_program/CUG10_Proceedings/pages/authors/11-15Wednesday/14C-mogill-slides.pdf
* Cover thread centric vs. data centric concurrency paradigms?
 * Mention OpenMP's implicit fork/join design?
* Cover lock vs. lock free algorithms? Just a mention?
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock-free_and_wait-free_algorithms
* Modern design pattern (model or primitive?!): Rx for stream processing - https://rx.codeplex.com
* No tuplespaces - seems purely a distributed computing problem
* Mutexes were the first paper on concurrent programming! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion
* M:N threading and recent proposals to create new linux syscalls to improve thread scheduling.

#### No time to mention

* Reentrant locks - Interesting history and controversies, but probably not worth diving into details.
